Google Maps and Directions API MVC 5

This is a simple project that I completed as part of a college assignment in which we had to create a simple web app that makes use of some
APIs.

My project makes use of the Google Maps and Google Directions API and it allows the user to select a starting location and end location as 
well as some stopping off points, the page would then display a map with the route.
